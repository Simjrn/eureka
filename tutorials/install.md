# Installing Eureka

Usually you would use `git clone` to install a programming language, but since there's only one file you need just download `eureka.py` in the `version 2` directory. Once you've done that move it into linux files. Run `python3 eureka.py` in the terminal, and then run `check`. If it does nothing, or gives an error, you've followed these steps incorrectly.
