# Maths

Eureka has all the operators that you would expect, although some have different syntax than other languages. 

The main differences are:

1. For the modulo operator, instead of `%`, it is `$`
2. For exponents, instead of `**`, it is `^`
3. For division without remainders, you use `--`
4. To check if 2 values are equal, instead of `==`, it is just `=`
5. To check if a value is equal or greater than another value, use `->`
6. To check if a value is equal or greater than another value, use `-<`
7. The spaceship operator, instead of being `<=>` like it is in other language, is `<->`. Just like in other languages, it returns -1, 0, 2.

Note that True is greater than False, and infinity is represented by 'inf'
